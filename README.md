# backorder_sale_prediction
forecasting the sales of a specific product based on the given dataset, with a particular focus on predicting backorder sales
Requirements

The following softwares/packages are required for running the scripts:

    Python 3.6.1
    Scikit-learn 0.19.0
    Imbalanced-learn 0.2.1


## Problem Statement

Backorders are a common problem for companies that sell products. When a product is out of stock and unavailable for purchase, it is called a backorder. Backorders can create several challenges for a company, including production delays, lost sales, and dissatisfied customers. To streamline production, logistics, and transportation, it is essential to anticipate which products will be backordered. 

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to forecast backorders and plan accordingly. The model will be based on historical data from inventories, supply chain, and sales. Given past data, the model should be able to classify products as going into backorder (Yes or No).

## Approach

The project will follow the classical machine learning tasks, which include:

1. Data Exploration: Explore the provided dataset and identify any patterns, trends, or outliers. 

2. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicate records, and outliers. 

3. Feature Engineering: Extract and transform relevant features from the dataset that can be used to predict backorders. 

4. Model Building: Try out different machine learning algorithms and choose the best one that can predict backorders accurately. 

5. Model Testing: Test the model on a test set to evaluate its performance and fine-tune the model if necessary.

## Results

The final solution will be a predictive model that can forecast backorders accurately for a given product. The model will help companies to streamline their production, logistics, and transportation by anticipating which products will be backordered.
